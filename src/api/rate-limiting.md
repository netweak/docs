# Rate limiting

To avoid abuses the number of requests you can make to the API in a specified amount of time is limited.
The current limitation (per user) is **100 requests per minute**.

::: warning
As the API is still in development we choose a very high rate limit, but it will certainly change in the future.
We highly recommend you put **caching mechanisms** in place to reduce the number of requests made to the API.

It is normally not possible to increase your limits right now but [let us know](https://netweak.com/contact) if needed and we'll see how we can get you sorted.
